# Objective

The objective of this [survey](https://forms.gle/791dhPnxgLVPzgyG9) was to
understand the influence ads have on people's purchase decisions and on what
aspect of ads do people focus on the most.

# Required libraries

The following `R` libraries are used for this analysis.

```{r}
library(dplyr) # for wrangling data
library(ggplot2) # for making plots
library(readr) # for reading data
```

# Reading the data

```{r}
ad_influence_data <- read_csv("ad-influence.csv") %>%
  select(!Timestamp) # ignore timestamp column
n <- dim(ad_influence_data)[1]
```

At the time of writing `r n` responses have been collected.
